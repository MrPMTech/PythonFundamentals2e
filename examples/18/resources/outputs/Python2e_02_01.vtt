00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
For our next test drive, we're going to take a look at executing a full Python program using the IPython interpreter at the command line once again.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:20.000
For the purpose of this particular demonstration, you are going to need to change into the examples folder containing the book's examples,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and specifically the subfolder 01, which contains the stuff for this lesson.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And in order to do that, I've provided the CD commands for Mac OS and Linux, as well as two different versions for Windows.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So if you're a Mac OS or Linux user, you can use the shorthand tilde forward slash documents to go into your documents folder,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and then the examples folder and the 01 folder.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
If you're on Windows, depending on which Anaconda command line you're using, the way that you change folders is a little bit different.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So if you use the Anaconda prompt, which is based on the command prompt window in Microsoft Windows,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
your CD command is going to be percent user profile percent, which is your user folder on your system,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and then backslash documents, backslash examples, backslash 01.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
If you're using the Anaconda PowerShell window, which also has some Mac OS Linux-like capabilities,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.000
in that case you're going to use the CD command with dollar home, backslash documents, backslash examples, backslash 01.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So you may want to pause the video to copy down the proper command,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and also I just want to remind you that if when you downloaded our code examples,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
you did not put the examples folder directly into your documents folder,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
or if you renamed it, you will obviously also need to go ahead and update these.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
For this demo, I'm once again starting from a fresh terminal window,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
just to remind you that if you're going to work with the custom environment we set up back in the Before You Begin lesson,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
you will need to activate that environment,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and the activation needs to be done for every new terminal window you open.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So if you close the last one, you are going to have to reactivate the environment.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So I'm now in my Python 3.13 version of the environment,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and currently I'm actually in my user accounts root folder,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
but I will type the CD command using that anyway.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So tilde forward slash, no matter where you happen to be at any given time, will go to your user accounts folder,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and I'm going to use a little command line auto-completion here.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
On Mac OS and Linux, your command lines are case sensitive,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and I do have a folder that starts with capital D-O-C, which is my documents folder,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
so if I hit tab now, it'll auto-complete that for me,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and for example, I can auto-complete the examples folder, and then finish this path off with the 01.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Once you are in the folder, you can confirm its contents by listing them out.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
On Mac OS and Linux, that's going to be the L-S command.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
You can also use that in a Windows PowerShell as well.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
In a Windows regular command prompt or the Anaconda prompt,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
you can use the D-I-R command to get a directory listing, if you would like.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
The script that we're about to run in this case is called RollDyDynamic.py.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
It's a full Python program that we're actually going to build at the end of lesson six.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000
It is a dynamic visualization that demonstrates the law of large numbers in action.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000
In this script, we're going to roll a six-sided die, or I should say simulate rolling a six-sided die,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and the more times we roll a six-sided die, if it's a balanced die,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000
we should get approximately the same number of 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, and 6s,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
about 16.667% of the total rolls.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
As I run this, I've set this script up with command line arguments

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000
that allow me to change how many dice I roll and how many animation frames I create as well,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
so that we can demonstrate this a couple of different ways.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
So as I do with interactive coding, even when I run scripts in these videos,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
I will use the IPython interpreter to run this script,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and I'll use some command line auto-completion here.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Just a reminder, when you're running a script, you can also run with the plain Python command,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
which you'll have with any Python distribution.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
This particular script does require two command line arguments.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
The first one is going to be the number of animation frames you would like to produce,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000
and the second one is going to be the number of dice to simulate rolling per animation frame.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So in this particular demo, we're only going to roll one die at a time,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and we're going to do that 600 times overall in separate animation frames

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.000
that summarize the rolls so far in a visualization called a bar plot.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
So now we can see the visualization on the screen.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
It's rolling one die at a time very rapidly at the moment,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and we can kind of see the bars jumping and dancing,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and at the top of every bar, we have the current die frequency

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and the percentage of the total die rolls overall.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Now the bulk of this diagram was produced actually with a single line of code

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
using a function from a library called Seaborn,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
which is a visualization library with lots of powerful features

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:53.000
that sits on top of another very powerful visualization library called matplotlib.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And Seaborn makes matplotlib easier to use, prettier,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and also adds some of its own visualization capabilities on top of matplotlib as well.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
So when we do build this visualization at the end of lesson six,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
I'll show you the one method, or function rather,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
that produces the bulk of what you see here,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
and a lot of the code in that example is to do all the additional labeling in text

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
that you see in this particular diagram.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Now when you're doing a small number of rolls,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
the law of large numbers does not tend to play out.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
But if we have a good random number generator in Python,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and we roll more dice over time, we should see these bars start to even out.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
So let's go ahead and run this again.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I'll recall the last command that I executed at the command line with an up arrow.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And let's roll, instead of one die per frame, let's roll 100 dice per frame.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And so we can go ahead and rerun the simulation,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and already we see that the bars are starting to even out in height.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
There's still clearly a difference in the heights of several of these bars,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
but they're all in the 16% range overall right now,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000
and we're going to be doing a total of 60,000 die rolls in this simulation

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
when we're doing 600 frames and 100 die rolls per frame.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
So as we can see, it's just finishing up now,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and we did get pretty close to 16.667% across the board,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
but a little bit above and a little bit below, mostly, in this demonstration.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And of course, we can do it again and roll many more dice per animation frame.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Let's jack that up to, say, 10,000 dice per frame.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
So now we're going to do a million.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000
We should expect, rather, a million dice of each total overall.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And we'll go ahead and run that, and right away,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
we start seeing those bars evening out a lot faster overall.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And if we let this play out to the full 6 million die rolls

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
that we're doing at the moment, we should see these all zeroing in

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
pretty close to 16.6-something percent,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and we can already see that's playing out here.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
If you look at the numbers as they jump and dance,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
this one's a little bit higher at the moment,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
but we should see that start to come back down.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
And in fact, they all finished at the 16.6%

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
with a little bit higher number on the purple bar

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
than most of the other ones overall.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And if we keep rolling this, and it's a really good random number generator,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
over time, we should start to see every single one of these

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
top out at 16.667% overall.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
So kind of a fun way to demonstrate the law of large numbers in action.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And with this visualization, as soon as you close the window

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
that's running it, the program terminates,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
and now you're back to your command line

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
where you can do your other commands.
